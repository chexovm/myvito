# myvito
My version of Avito based on Mongo / Express / React / Node :)

To launch the app follow these steps:

How to launch the app's server side:
```
      cd back/             changes directory
      npm install          installs all dependencies in package.json
      npm start            launches server side of the app
```

How to launch the app's client side:
```
      cd front/            changes directory
      npm install          installs all dependencies in package.json
      npm start            launches client side of the app
```


This is a work in progress.
